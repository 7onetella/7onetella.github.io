      <description>Context I tried learning about Puppet and Chef a while back. I was trying to use Puppet or Chef to update running Vagrant machines. That was more for setting up local development environment.
Docker and ECS came around next. That improved application deployment. Docker solved two problems. Local development environment setup and application deployment in the cloud.
Since then there was no need for me to go back to learning about Puppet and Chef until now.</description>
